# MALL_CUSTOMER_HIERARCHICALC_CLUSTER
I have created Machine Learning Model With K-Means Clustering for CUSTOMER DATA..

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

# ABOUT Hierarchical Clustering for Customer Data

## Clustering
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters.

## Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.

## About the dataset
This input file contains the basic information (ID, age, gender, income, spending score) about the customers of a mall. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

# Final Note

__Thus, we have analysed Customer data and performed Hierarchical Clustering using Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm. This kind of cluster analysis helps design better customer acquisition strategies and helps in business growth. Let me know your feedback for this notebook, happy coding :)__

# HAPPY CODING !
